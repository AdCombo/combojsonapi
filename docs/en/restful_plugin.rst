RestfulPlugin (`EN`_ | `RU`_)
-----------------------------

**RestfulPlugin** is designed to work with **apispec**, which is used in **ApiSpecPlugin**.

**RestfulPlugin** generates views documentation based on API yaml description. Its main purpose is to describe RPC API made with **EventPlugin**.

Plugin usage sample is available `in EventPlugin description <https://github.com/AdCombo/combojsonapi/blob/master/docs/en/event_plugin.rst>`_.
In this sample, a view RPC API documentation is being parsed with RestfulPlugin and handed to **apispec**
for export into **swagger**.
